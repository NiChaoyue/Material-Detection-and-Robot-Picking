# Material-Detection-and-Robot-Picking
Vision-guided robotic arm system for material detection, localization, and picking. Utilizes ArUco markers for position and orientation estimation, Gaussian filtering for noise reduction, and YOLO models for multi-class, multi-pose part recognition, with control via inverse kinematics.
